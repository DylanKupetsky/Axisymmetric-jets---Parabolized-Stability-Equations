# Recreation of results from Yen & Messersmith 1998

Here, we recreate the results from [Application of Parabolized Stability Equations to the Prediction of Jet Instabilities](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/2.552?journalCode=aiaaj).The parabolized stability equations (PSE) offer an effecient approach for locating instabilities in boundary layer-type flows. Linear stability approaches assume the flow is locally parallel, whereas PSE assumes the flow is locally non-parallel. 

Code requires MATLAB engine in Python for generalized eigenvalue problem as the initial condition for the instabilities, but can be modified to work with SciPy as well.
